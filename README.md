# Telco_Customer_Churn-Analysis
This is a Machine Learning Analysis on the rate of customer churn for a telco company

# Aim and Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a customer churn prediction model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churn. By being able to identify potential churners, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and improve overall customer satisfaction and profitability.
 

# Columns üí°

* Gender -- Whether the customer is a male or a female

* TechSupport -- Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet)
* StreamingTV -- Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
* StreamingMovies -- Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No Internet service)

* MonthlyCharges -- The amount charged to the customer monthly
* TotalCharges -- The total amount charged to the customer
* Churn -- Whether the customer churned or not (Yes or No)

# Data Preprocessing
* Used Simple Imputer using the median to Impute the missing values
* Used Simple Imputer (most frequent) and One Hot Encoder to encode the other remaining categorical columns
* Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance in target variable(Churn column).
* Used Robust scaler to normalize the dataset

# Modelling
 The following Models were trained:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* XGBoost
* LightGBM
* catboost
* adaboost

# Final Model
Random Forest with an accuracy score of 86% and AUC score of 93% was selected.
